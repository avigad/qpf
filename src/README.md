- `for_mathlib.lean` : general infrastructure

- `pfunctor/` : polynomial functors, including M and W types

- `qpf.lean` : quotients of unary polynomial functors, initial algebras, final coalgebras, and closure under quotients and composition. This is subsumed by the multivariate versions later on, which do not depend on the unary version. But we will keep the unary ones around for reference.

- `mvfunctor/` : multivariate functors

- `mvpfunctor/` : multivariate polynomial functors, including multivariate M and W

- `mvqpf/` : multivariate qpfs

- `data/` : a Lean front end for specifying data types based on these constructions. This is still work in progress.
