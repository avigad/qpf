# Testing Data Type Compiler

 1. Edit [examples.lean](examples.lean)
 2. Uncomment lines 9 to 22 and lines 28 to 41
 3. Compile [examples.lean](examples.lean) using either:
    * the VS code Lean tool;
    * the emacs Lean tool; or
    * calling `lean test/examples.lean` in a terminal
4. For both `tree` and `tree'`, the first line `#print prefix tree` enumerates the declarations generated by Lean and by the QPF data type compiler
5. Below `#print prefix tree`, a list of `#print` and `#check` statements emphasizes the examples found in section 6 of *Data types as quotients of polynomial functors*
